## Description

This project was developed as part of a research initiative to classify celestial bodies using machine learning techniques, utilizing data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).
This project applies machine learning techniques to classify celestial bodies such as **stars**, **galaxies**, and **quasars** using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). <br>
We used statistical models, including **Model-Based Clustering**, **Model-Based Classification**, and the **Mixture of Experts Model** to group and classify celestial bodies.
The primary goal of the project was to identify distinct groups of celestial objects based on their characteristics and predict the likelihood of various classifications. <br>
Key features such as redshift, photometric filters (u, g, r, i, z), and other spectroscopic data were analyzed to find relationships between the data and the classification of objects.

## Output

The `CelestialBodies.pdf` provides a comprehensive summary of the project, detailing the methodology, data analysis, model development, and evaluation of results.
